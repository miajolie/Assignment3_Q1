The Kotlin app consists of the following features:
- Build a screen with a Row where one section takes 25% width and the other 75% width.
- Inside the larger section, use a Column with 3 weighted children of different proportions (e.g., 2:3:5).
- Add colors and text labels to visualize space usage.

* The App should display only these features once running, no interaction needed
